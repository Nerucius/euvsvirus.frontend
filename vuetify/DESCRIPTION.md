## Inspiration

 We are looking towards a bittersweet future where we might still need to distance ourselves from other people while we are outside. And that includes when we work out. Imagine going out for a jog and having to come into close contact with other people who had the same idea as you, and unfortunately went to the same nice park at the same time as you. If only you could have known!

## What it does

This is where SDW comes into play. Be able to take a quick glance of your city and know exactly where people are planning to go cycling, jogging, swimming. And avoid those areas! Want to contribute to the platform and mark an area where you're going to be minding your business? You can do that aswell. Bonus points, people will also avoid you now that they know wherein you plan to workout. Everyone wins.

## How we built it

We're building this app using the latest web technologies available, including a powerful framework for reactive behavior (Vue). For our backend and data, we're setting up a web service using Kotlin connected to a PostgreSQL database.

## Challenges we ran into

The map interface for movile is a big challenge, drawing polygons is a big challenge.
